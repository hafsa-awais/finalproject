## Project description

Our project will be a company that operates an online marketplace for locations that can be used for events i.e. birthdays, weddings, parties, family gatherings, etc. The general public (including companies and public entities) will be able to have their own accounts and offer properties that can be rented out for these events. They can also have a rating as an person responsible of the property.

The business will be monetised by charging a percentage fee of the rent and additional fees for any additional service. The renter has an easy to use platform, where they can consult all necessary information about their business, which can also help in their administrative obligations. Other kind of services can be offered, like cleaning, sound installation, decorative installation, catering, etc.

The target market will be adults of any age group. The purpose of this will be to aid in the search for venues and have all the suitable locations under one roof. This type of service doesn’t seem to exist in Luxembourg (at the moment).
