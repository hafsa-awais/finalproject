Had a wonderful experience with the venue and the hosts! They were very cooperative and were there to help out if needed. 

This was truly a wedding we will remember for a while! It was such a beautiful place.

Beautiful little place! It was truly a paradise of solitude and tranquility. Will recommend 10/10.

We had a small little birthday arranged for our kid who is 2. He absolutely loved the place and everything!

Lovely place. Amazing old building and location is spectacular.

The view is breathtaking magical, the place is very beautiful, and the host is amazing!

I would say if you are considering renting this place out, don't think twice! It's perfect.
